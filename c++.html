<h1> C++ </h1>  
<pre><h3>C++  is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming 
language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, 
generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always 
implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, 
Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.

C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with 
performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other 
contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,including desktop 
applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web search, or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications 
(e.g. telephone switches or space probes).

C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified 
and published by ISO in December 2017  The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998  which was then 
amended by the C++03, C++11 and C++14 standards. The current C++17 standard supersedes these with new features and an 
enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne 
Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar 
to C that also provided high-level features for program organization. C++20 is the next planned standard, keeping with the 
current trend of a new version every three years</h3></pre>
