<h1> SQL</h1>  
<pre><h3>SQL"sequel"; Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for 
managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream 
management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among 
entities and variables.

SQL offers two main advantages over older read–write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. Firstly, it introduced the concept of 
accessing many records with one single command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, e.g. with 
or without an index.

Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of many types of statements,which may 
be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly: a data query language (DQL), a data definition language (DDL), a data 
control language (DCL), and a data manipulation language (DML). The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation 
(insert, update and delete), data definition (schema creation and modification), and data access control. Although SQL is 
essentially a declarative language (4GL), it also includes procedural elements.

SQL was one of the first commercial languages to utilize Edgar F. Codd’s relational model. The model was described in his 
influential 1970 paper, "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks". Despite not entirely adhering to the 
relational model as described by Codd, it became the most widely used database language.

SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) in 1987. Since then the standard has been revised to include a larger set of features. Despite the 
existence of standards, most SQL code requires at least some changes before being ported to different database systems</h3></pre>
